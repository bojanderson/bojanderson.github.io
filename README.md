This is a personal website for Bo Anderson. I am doing this both to have a personal website and also to have a side project for learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git.

If you want to help me with this site then I'm totally amazed, because I don't see any reason anybody would want to do that.

I am starting by using the w3school HTML tutorial for this site - https://www.w3schools.com/html/

I am using some branches for learning and practicing and then pushing releases out occasionally as I decide.

Say hello to Editorial, a blog/magazine-ish template built around a toggleable "locking"
sidebar (scroll down to see what I mean) and an accordion-style menu. Not the usual landing
page/portfolio affair you'd expect to see at HTML5 UP, but I figured for my 41st (!!!)
template I'd change it up a little. Enjoy :)
