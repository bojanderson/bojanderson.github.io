This is a personal website for Bo Anderson. I am doing this both to have a personal website and also to have a side project for learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git.

If you want to help me with this site then I'm totally amazed, because I don't see any reason anybody would want to do that.

I am starting by using the w3school HTML tutorial for this site - https://www.w3schools.com/html/

I am using some branches for learning and practicing and then pushing releases out occasionally as I decide.
